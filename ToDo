To do: 
Change the installers from needing to be on the flash drive to downloading from the internet, should be simple once I find the permalinks
add a bitlocker enable and have it enable and encrypt "Bitlocker" automatically and have it save the recovery key to an external source (TBD by sercurity)
Make it set PC to need password immidiatly after going to sleep and have it sleep or lock after 15 minutes of inactivity
